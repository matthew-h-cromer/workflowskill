# WorkflowSkill Reference Implementation

## Project Overview

A standalone TypeScript runtime that parses, validates, and executes WorkflowSkill YAML definitions. A user describes a workflow in natural language, an LLM generates WorkflowSkill YAML, and the runtime executes it.

**Repo layout:**
- `SPEC.md` — language specification (source of truth for all behavior)
- `PROPOSAL.md` — justification and alternatives
- `examples/` — runnable workflow examples (at repo root, referenced from SPEC.md and PROPOSAL.md)
- `runtime/` — reference TypeScript implementation (all source, tests, and tooling live here)

## Verify Every Change

**Run from `runtime/` after every change:** `npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run lint`

- **The spec is the source of truth.** Read `SPEC.md` before modifying any module. If the spec and the implementation disagree, the spec wins.
- **Mock external dependencies.** No API calls in unit or integration tests. Use the adapter interfaces.
- **Keep CLAUDE.md current.** After completing any iteration, update this file to reflect what changed.
- **If the spec is ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and document it in a code comment.**

## Do Not Edit

- **`runtime/src/generator/skill-prompt.ts`** — auto-generated from `runtime/src/generator/workflow-author.md`. Edit the `.md`, then run `npx tsx scripts/generate-skill-prompt.ts` from `runtime/`.
- **`runtime/package-lock.json`** — managed by npm.

## Engineering Principles

- **No silent fallbacks.** Throw clear errors. Never silently degrade.
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** Fix the prompt, not the extraction logic.
- **Improve the skill, not the parser.** When LLM output causes runtime failures, fix the workflow-author skill to generate better prompts — don't add parsing heuristics to the executor. Other spec implementations won't share custom parsing logic.

**Dependency flow:** types → parser + expression → validator + executor → runtime → cli + generator

## Key Design Decisions

- **LLM executor does NOT wrap output** in the first output key. Output is stored directly (like tool steps). This ensures `$steps.<id>.output.field` works consistently across step types.
- **Transform executor DOES wrap output** in the first declared output key (e.g., `{ filtered: [...] }`), since transforms produce arrays that need naming.
- **ExitStep.output** supports both `string` (expression) and `Record<string, unknown>` (object literal with resolvable values). The spec examples use both forms.
- **Branch steps** (those referenced in conditional then/else) are collected upfront and skipped during sequential execution, only run when selected by a conditional.
- **`each` iteration** is handled by the runtime, not the executor. The runtime calls the executor once per item with `$item`/`$index` in context.
- **`${}` template interpolation** replaces the removed `+` operator for string building. String `value` fields containing `${ref}` are interpolated: `"${inputs.base_url}${item}.json"`. References inside `${...}` omit the `$` prefix. Whole-value `${ref}` preserves type. Escape with `$${` for literal `${`. Primary use case: constructing dynamic URLs in `each` + tool patterns.
- **Unified `value` field** on step inputs, step outputs, and workflow outputs. Strings starting with `$` are auto-detected as expressions; strings containing `${...}` are templates; all others are literals. Escape literal `$` with `$$` (e.g., `value: "$$100"` → `"$100"`). Parser normalizes legacy `source`/`default` to `value` via Zod transforms for backwards compatibility. **Workflow inputs use `default`** instead of `value` — it's an overridable fallback, not a fixed value. Parser normalizes legacy `value` → `default` on workflow inputs for backwards compat.
- **Step output `value`** uses `$result` to map from the raw executor result. Resolved immediately after dispatch, before storing in context. Per-element mapping in `each` loops.
- **Workflow output `value`** uses `$steps` references to map from the final runtime context. Resolved after all steps complete. Exit step output takes precedence when fired.
- **Backwards compatibility** — outputs without `value` use legacy key-matching behavior. Legacy `source`/`default` fields are accepted at parse time and normalized to `value`.
- **Run log observability** — `StepRecord` includes `inputs` (resolved values passed to the executor), `retries` (attempt count + per-attempt error messages when retries occurred), and enriched `error` messages (prefixed with tool name for tool steps, step/field context for expression failures). These fields satisfy PR7/PR8 requirements for debugging artifacts.
- **Runtime events** use the same `onEvent` callback pattern as `ConversationEvent` in the generator. `RuntimeEvent` is a discriminated union on `type`, optional on `RunOptions`. Events emitted from runtime internals; rendering in `renderRuntimeEvent()` in `runtime/src/cli/format.ts`. All CLI live output goes to stderr; stdout reserved for JSON run log.
- **Every run attempt produces a run log** — parse failures, validation failures, and execution failures all produce a structured `RunLog` on stdout and disk. `runWorkflow()` returns a `RunLog` on validation failure (no longer throws `WorkflowExecutionError`). `buildFailedRunLog(name, error, startedAt?)` constructs the minimal log for pre-execution failures. `RunLogError` carries `phase: 'parse' | 'validate' | 'execute'`, `message`, and optional `details`. `WorkflowExecutionError` is kept exported for backwards compatibility but is no longer thrown by `runWorkflow()`.

## Development Commands

All commands run from `runtime/`:

```
cd runtime

npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm run test               # Run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
npm run lint               # ESLint
npm run build              # Build with tsdown
npm run validate:examples  # Validate all workflow fixtures

# CLI (via tsx for development)
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts validate <files...>
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts run <file>
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts generate "<prompt>"
```

## Credential Configuration

Set env vars or create a `.env` file in `runtime/`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...       # Required for real LLM calls
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...               # Optional: enables Gmail/Sheets tools
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
```

The CLI gracefully degrades: no API key → mock adapters with a warning. No Google creds → Google tools not registered (warning if workflow references them).
